# Real Time Simulator 

This is a project for Real Time Systems course. The main goal of this project is to create set real time tasks (with configurable execution times and relative periods) mesure worst case responce time and compare this responce time with theoretical responce time computed using RTA.

Needed libgonfig (I instaled it like this sudo apt-get install libconfig++8-dev), gnuplot
Code intended with indent -kr -i8 -l120
